# MySimpleHTTP

This is a simple HTTP server that can be used to handle .txt files. after compiling the three .c files by the "make all" command, you can run "server" and choose which type of client you want to use. Once chosen, you can run a client in a new terminal on your machine. Each client requires different actions from the server but it's important to cimpile "client.c" before running "async_client.c".
